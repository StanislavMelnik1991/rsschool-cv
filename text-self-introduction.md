My name is Stanislav.
I live in Minsk together with my wife and dog.
I love cycling and jogging.
I've done a marathon, and I dream of someday completing half of the Iron Man. (That's 1.9km swimming, then 90km biking and 21km jogging.)
I know how to play the guitar. 
Earlier I was a fan of Rope Jumping and made more than 300 jumps from various objects in Belarus.
Recently started playing board games. 

My education is an incomplete higher education.
I've been studying at the Belarusian State University of Technology in Biotechnology for 4 years.

For the last 10 years I worked in construction materials trade.
At my last job I developed a program in Visual Basic which greatly reduced the time of customer service, 
    which is still used in most major construction stores across Belarus.
After that, I thought about changing my profession and going into the IT field.

At first I considered the profession of a tester.
I planned to study the profession within 3-5 months, which was enough to become junior QA and find a job.

For this purpose I even quit my job, so I could spend more time for training.
But on February 24 it turned out that I could not find a job quickly, so I decided to study a more interesting profession. 

Right at that time the Stage-1 program at the RS-School began and I went to study there.
I didn't have to decide on the programming language, because my wife already studied JS front-end, so she could help me with learning.

RS-School gave me a good theoretical knowledge of the HTML code and native JS, teaching me to use the version control system GIT.

In addition to this, I have done several interesting (and not very) projects.
The most important one is Shelter.
It was a long (3 weeks) project through which I was able to consistently learn HTML, CSS and JS, virtually from scratch.

Now I'm beginning to learn React and Type Scrypt as the most commonly used libraries.
I plan to try writing my own online store with React

Right now I'm looking for a job as a front-end developer.
