    <h2>About myself:</h2>
    <section class="d">
        <p>My name is Stanislav.</p>
        <p>I live in Minsk together with my wife and dog.</p>
        <p>I love cycling and jogging.</p>
        <p>I've done a marathon, and I dream of someday completing half of the Iron Man. <br>(That's 1.9km swimming, then 90km biking and 21km jogging.)</p>
        <p class="p">I know how to play the guitar. </p>
        <p class="p">Earlier I was a fan of Rope Jumping and made more than 300 jumps from various objects in Belarus.</p>
        <p>Recently started playing board games. </p>
        <p class="p">My education is an incomplete higher education.</p>
        <p>I've been studying at the Belarusian State Technological University of Biotechnology for 4 years.</p>
        <p class="p"></p>
        <p>For the last 10 years I worked in construction materials trade.</p>
        <p>At my last job I developed a program in Visual Basic which greatly reduced the time of customer service,<br>which is still used in most major construction stores across Belarus.</p>
        <p>After that, I thought about changing my profession and going into the IT field.</p>
        <p class="p">At first I considered the profession of a tester.</p>
        <p>I planned to study the profession within 3-5 months, <br>which was enough to become junior QA and find a job.</p>
        <p class="p">For this purpose I even quit my job, so I could spend more time for training.</p>
        <p>But on February 24 it turned out that I could not find a job quickly,<br>so I decided to study a more interesting profession.</p>
        <p class="p">Right at that time the Stage-1 program at the RS-School began and I went to study there.</p>
        <p>I didn't have to decide on the programming language, <br>because my wife already studied JS front-end, so she could help me with learning.</p>
        <p class="p">RS-School gave me a good theoretical knowledge of the HTML code and native JS, <br>teaching me to use the version control system GIT.</p>
        <p>In addition to this, I have done several interesting (and not very) projects.</p>
        <p>The most important one is Shelter.</p>
        <p>It was a long (3 weeks) project through which I was able to consistently learn HTML, <br>CSS and JS, virtually from scratch.</p>
        <p class="p">Now I'm beginning to learn React and Type Scrypt as the most commonly used libraries.</p>
        <p>I plan to try writing my own online store with React</p>
        <p class="p">Right now I'm looking for a job as a front-end developer.</p>
